# LaTeX templates
This is Lulof Pir√©e's personal collection of LaTeX templates.
These templates are particularly practical when used in conjunction
with the template-manager `temman`.

Every subdirectory is another template.
When you wish to create a new LaTeX project, you can copy one of
the subdirectories as a starting template.
Or better, let `temman` do the copying for you,
then you can resynchronise your project later with the template
if either of the two happen to change.

## Available templates:
* `report`: template for a mathematical article or homework assignment.
    Comes a lot of packages (esp. for mathematics) 
    macros (e.g., for category theory) as well as configures many settings,
    such as paragraph indents, the looks of theorems, etc.
* `greenslides`: template for a beamer slideshow with a green theme.
    Comes with a lot of mathematical macros.
