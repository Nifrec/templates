# LaTeX templates
This is Lulof Pirée's personal collection of LaTeX templates.
These templates are particularly practical when used in conjunction
with the template-manager `temman`.

Every subdirectory is another template.
When you wish to create a new LaTeX project, you can copy one of
the subdirectories as a starting template.
Or better, let `temman` do the copying for you,
then you can resynchronise your project later with the template
if either of the two happen to change.
